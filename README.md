The "Cloud Resource Management Tool" is a comprehensive web application that seamlessly integrates Full Stack Web Development with Cloud services, focusing on Amazon Web Services (AWS). As one of the leading cloud platforms with a significant market share in the industry, AWS offers a wide range of services that allow companies to efficiently deliver their services and host websites without upfront expenses.  

This project aims to leverage the power of AWS and various other technologies to create a user-friendly web app capable of managing AWS services, including EC2, S3, SNS, IAM, EBS, SES, and more. In addition to AWS, the project incorporates other cutting-edge technologies such as Docker, Python, Machine Learning, Hadoop Cluster, Generative AI, MLOps, Jenkins, and Linux. The integration of these technologies enhances the functionality and efficiency of the application, providing users with a seamless experience in managing their cloud resources.
